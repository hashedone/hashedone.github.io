              The challange was that hotels uses different way to define their prices, and we had to define the flexible
              system. On top of that, system had to be performant - hardware running the search engine was limited, so
              it needed to leverage the Rust high performance premise to keep the high throughput.
              All my work was around backend Rust development, with high autonomy. Most of the time me and the team lead
              was the only two people taking care of this particular product part.

              Credit Suisse was one of the most interersting steps in my career. I was involved in the product that was
              full rewrite of the credit-rist estimation engine. The product was supposed to analyze transactions
              on the stock that happened particular day, to build base for predicting the risk of future transactions.
              One of the most important requirements for the product was the high performance - the number of transactions
              to analyze was overwhelming, and the goal was to get all of calculation done by the next trading day start.
              However calculation correctness was not less important - the outcome was not only strongly affecting the
              further Quants efficiency, but also the way of the credit risk measurement is strongly controlled by
              goverments, so correctess of the implementation was relevant from legal standpoint. Finally the product stability
              was also key. As the calculations had to be correct and fast any stability bugs could highly affect the outcome value
              by delying it, or excluding some batch of trades from calculations.

              was done in very low level C++ dialect that was somewhat closer to working with C, to avoid any overhead,
              keeping simulation close to realtime. The simulator was written using SystemC library being sort of a

              the prototype of rotary carousel milking cows continously. Here I was working across different stack levels.
              I had to learn how to program simple PLCs making sure that when product mallfunctions, the operator or animal
              doesn't get hurt. Also I was working on drivers maintaining the communication with basic hardware - ensuring
              proper rotary speed, detaching milking station when needed, and on higher level instrumenting entire process.
              Also the product was used by the human operator, so there was also communication with our UI application was
              a part of the solution. Also in this company for the first time I had some impact on decision making. Regardless
